# Thyroid Cancer Risk Analysis

Explored clinical and demographic features to understand thyroid cancer risk and improve prediction accuracy.

---

## Project Summary

This project analyzes a large thyroid cancer dataset containing patient-level information such as age, gender, hormone levels, nodule size, ethnicity, radiation exposure, and diagnosis. Through EDA and statistical modeling, we evaluate the reliability of an existing risk scoring system and explore how machine learning can enhance early cancer detection.

---

##  Key Objectives

- Analyze distribution of malignancy across clinical features (e.g., TSH, T3, T4 levels, nodule size)
- Identify discrepancies in the existing Thyroid_Cancer_Risk scoring system
- Handle outliers and inconsistent values in clinical markers
- Build a logistic regression model to detect malignancy
- Address class imbalance to improve recall for malignant cases

---

##  Techniques Used

- **Data Cleaning & Validation**
- **Class Imbalance Handling** (class_weight=balanced)
- **Feature Engineering** (abnormal hormone levels, remodel flags)
- **Visualizations**:
  - Box plots, heatmaps, count plots, bar charts
  - Grouped aggregations by diagnosis and risk category
- **Statistical Modeling**:
  - Logistic Regression with Evaluation Metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

---

##  Key Insights

- Over **27,000 malignant patients** were mislabeled as Low or Medium risk â€” indicating a **conservative bias** in the risk scoring system.
- **Radiation exposure** and **abnormal nodule size** are strong clinical predictors of malignancy.
- A logistic regression model using just 4 features achieved:
  - **Recall (Malignant class)**: 52%
  - **False negatives reduced by 50%**
- The model demonstrated better sensitivity than the original scoring system, making it a useful adjunct for patient triage.
